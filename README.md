1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The biggest problem I had throughout the projects was getting the data to load correctly. I had everything working aside from some bad_alloc errors that occurred during the ending stages of the project.

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem just as I do any other, I assessed the problem and broke it down into smaller parts for me to solve. Understanding the databases is incredibly important and doing this project I worked with vectors, trees, and hash tables to determine which one was the most efficient for this task. Ultimately I went with a vector data structure because it was the easiest to work with.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I got through my roadblocks by using the resources available to me such as the zybooks textbook and tutorial videos on YouTube. I can also ask my grandfather and uncles coding questions because that’s what they work with.

4.How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on this project has opened my eyes in regard to memory management. I’ve never had any sort of allocation errors before so having to deal with that was a new experience. I will most certainly keep memory allocation in mind moving forward in my programming.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Just like all of my other projects, this one will act as a building block to my overall understanding of how to code and use databases in C++. This project has made me aware of memory allocation and being sure to pick a database that will best suit the information you’re trying to access.
